Not quite familiar with this. Time for learning.

Why does the term "23 types design patterns" sound like an idol unit?

Anyway the pattern lays like below:
  -Creational pattern
    1. Factory pattern
    2. Abstract factory pattern
    3. Builder pattern
    4. Prototype pattern
    5. Singleton pattern
  
  -Structural pattern
    6. Adapter pattern
    7. Bridge pattern
    8. Composite pattern
    9. Decorator pattern
    10. Facade pattern
    11. Flyweight pattern
    12. Proxy pattern
  
  -Behavioral pattern
    I. "Agent in middle" -- Access object through some kind of agent, mediator, etc.
      13. Interpreter pattern
      14. Mediator pattern
      15. Visitor pattern
      
    II. "Between parent and child" -- Pattern deploys in hierarchically class structure.
      16. Strategy pattern
      17. Template method pattern
    
    III. "Inter-Classes" -- Pattern deploys between classes.
      18. Chain of responsibility pattern
      19. Command pattern
      20. Iterator pattern
      21. Observer pattern
    
    IV. "Status of object" -- Pattern about state of an object.
      22. Memento pattern
      23. State pattern
      
Even this Readme takes hella times to write. What the fudge.
